# DroneFaceDetection

Dji Tello drone that detects a face and tracks its movements.

Opencv was used to detect the face in the frame.

Multiple parameters can be controlled by changing the "config.json" file.

A dead zone was introduced to the drone so that its movement is smooth and to eliminate minor movements all the time.
